# Predicting-Fraudulent-Transactions

- This case requires to develop a model for predicting fraudulent transactions for a
  financial company and use insights from the model to develop an actionable plan.
- Data for the case is available in CSV format having 6362620 rows and 10 columns.
  Develop machine learning model regardless of the method and the technique used.
- Following usual model development procedures, the model would be estimated on the
  calibration data and tested on the validation data. This case requires both statistical analysis and
  creativity/judgment.
- Fine-tuning and interpreting the results of your machine learning model also deployement is expected.
